    # Workload A: Small cardinality consistent data for 2 days
    #   Application example: Typical monitoring of a single compute or small
    #   sensor station where 90% of the load is write and only 10% is read
    #   (it's usually much less). All writes are inserts. No sparsity so
    #   every series will have a value at every timestamp.
    #
    #   Read/insert ratio: 10/90
    #   Cardinality: 16 per key (field), 64 fields for a total of 1,024
    #                time series.

    #   Default data size: 1 KB records (10 fields, 100 bytes each, plus key)

    # scattered around the keyspace if they are keyed by userid.timestamp. A workload
    # which orders items purely by time, and demands the latest, is very different than
    # workload here (which we believe is more typical of how people build systems.)

    # Workload E: Short ranges
    #   Application example: threaded conversations, where each scan is for the posts in a given thread (assumed to be clustered by thread id)
    #
    #   Scan/insert ratio: 95/5
    #   Default data size: 1 KB records (10 fields, 100 bytes each, plus key)
    #   Request distribution: zipfian
    # The insert order is hashed, not ordered. Although the scans are ordered, it does not necessarily
    # follow that the data is inserted in order. For example, posts for thread 342 may not be inserted contiguously, but
    # instead interspersed with posts from lots of other threads. The way the YCSB client works is that it will pick a start
    # key, and then request a number of records; this works fine even for hashed insertion.
