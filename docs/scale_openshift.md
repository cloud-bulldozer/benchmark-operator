# Scale Openshift

## What does it do?

The Scale Openshift functionality allows a user to scale their environment to a provided size 
and obtain the time it takes for the scaling procedure. This data will also be indexed if 
Elasticsearch information is provided.

## Variables

The scale workload takes the following required variables:

`scale` the target number of workers to scale to.

Optional variables:

`poll_interval` how long, in seconds, to wait between polls to see if the scaling is complete. default: 5

`post_sleep` how long, in seconds, to wait after the scaling is complete before marking the pod as complete. default: 0

`label` a dictionary consisting of 'key' and 'value'. If provided it will require to launch the node with
        matching key and value

`tolerations` a dictionary consisting of a 'key', 'value' and 'effect'. If provided it will add a toleration
        for the matching key/value/effect

`runtime_class` If this is set, the benchmark-operator will apply the runtime_class to the podSpec runtimeClassName.

`annotations` If this is set, the benchmark-operator will set the specified annotations on the pods' metadata.

`rosa` For clusters installed using ROSA. Following parameters will be required:

`rosa.cluster_name` Name of cluster as it is shown on `rosa list clusters` command

`rosa.env` ROSA environment where cluster is installed.

`rosa.token` ROSA token required to execute commands

`aws` AWS credentials required by ROSA cli to execute scalation commands

`aws.access_key_id` Exported as AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID

`aws.secret_access_key` Exported as AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

`aws.default_region` Exported as AWS_DEFAULT_REGION

Your resource file may look like this when using all avaible options:

```yaml
apiVersion: ripsaw.cloudbulldozer.io/v1alpha1
kind: Benchmark
metadata:
  name: scale
  namespace: benchmark-operator
spec:
  elasticsearch:
    url: "http://es-instance.com:9200"
    index_name: ripsaw-scale
  workload:
    name: scale_openshift
    args:
      scale: 25
      poll_interval: 2
      post_sleep: 300
      label:
        key: node-role.kubernetes.io/workload
        value: ""
      tolerations:
        key: role
        value: workload
        effect: NoSchedule
      rosa:
        cluster_name: rosa-test-01
        env: staging
        token: "xxxx"
      aws:
        access_key_id: XXXXX
        secret_access_key: XXXXXX
        default_region: us-west-2
```

*NOTE:* If the cluster is already at the desired scale the timings will still be captured and uploaded to
Elasticsearch (if provided). The overall time will simply be the time it took the scale process to confirm
that the cluster is at the correct scale.
