# Flent

[Flent](https://flent.org/) is a network performance tool

## Running Flent

Given that you followed instructions to deploy operator,
you can modify [cr.yaml](../resources/crds/ripsaw_v1alpha1_flent_cr.yaml)

```yaml
apiVersion: ripsaw.cloudbulldozer.io/v1alpha1
kind: Benchmark

```
Not every test works in benchmark-operator. Tests that require something other than netserver will not work. Tests that require additional arguments will also not work.
The voip tests do not work, and the cisco and burst tests do not work.

The tcp_*, udp_, and more should work. tcp_download was the most tested test.


`client_resources` and `server_resources` will create flent client's and server's containers with the given k8s compute resources respectively [k8s resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-compute-resources-container/)

`hostnetwork` will test the performance of the node the pod will run on.

*Note:* If you want to run with hostnetwork on `OpenShift`, you will need to execute the following:

```bash

$ oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z benchmark-operator

```

`image` The snafu image built for flent. Optional. Defaults to the cloud-bulldozer one.

`pin` will allow the benchmark runner place nodes on specific nodes, using the `hostname` label.

`pin_server` what node to pin the server pod to.

`pin_client` what node to pin the client pod to.

`multus[1]` Configure our pods to use multus.

[1] https://github.com/intel/multus-cni/tree/master/examples

```yaml
  hostnetwork: false
  multus:
    enabled: false
  pair: 2
  test_types:
    - tcp_download
  runtime: 30
```

Will run the flent test `tcp_download` on two pairs of server and clients for 30 seconds.
The output of tcp_download will include the summary plus the details of the downloads and pings.

If the user desires to test with Multus, use the below Multus `NetworkAtachmentDefinition`
as an example:

```
apiVersion: "k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1"
kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition
metadata:
  name: macvlan-range-0
spec:
  config: '{
            "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
            "type": "macvlan",
            "master": "eno1",
            "mode": "bridge",
            "ipam": {
                    "type": "host-local",
                    "ranges": [
                    [ {
                       "subnet": "11.10.0.0/16",
                       "rangeStart": "11.10.1.20",
                       "rangeEnd": "11.10.3.50"
                    } ] ]
            }
        }'
---
apiVersion: "k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1"
kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition
metadata:
  name: macvlan-range-1
spec:
  config: '{
            "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
            "type": "macvlan",
            "master": "eno1",
            "mode": "bridge",
            "ipam": {
                    "type": "host-local",
                    "ranges": [
                    [ {
                       "subnet": "11.10.0.0/16",
                       "rangeStart": "11.10.1.60",
                       "rangeEnd": "11.10.3.90"
                    } ] ]
            }
        }'
```

This will use the same IP subnet across nodes, but not overlap
IP addresses.

To enable Multus in Ripsaw, here is the relevant config.

```
      ...
      multus:
        enabled: true
        client: "macvlan-range-0"
        server: "macvlan-range-1"
      pin: true
      pin_server: "openshift-master-0.dev4.kni.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com"
      pin_client: "openshift-master-1.dev4.kni.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com"
      ...

```

Once done creating/editing the resource file, you can run it by:

```bash
# kubectl apply -f resources/crds/ripsaw_v1alpha1_flent_cr.yaml # if edited the original one
# kubectl apply -f <path_to_file> # if created a new cr file
```

### Storing results into Elasticsearch

```yaml
apiVersion: ripsaw.cloudbulldozer.io/v1alpha1
kind: Benchmark
metadata:
  name: example-benchmark
  namespace: ripsaw-system
spec:
  clustername: myk8scluster
  test_user: test_user # user is a key that points to user triggering ripsaw, useful to search results in ES
  elasticsearch:
    server: <es_host>
    port: <es_port>
  workload:
    name: flent
    args:
      hostnetwork: false
      multus:
        enabled: false
      pin: false
      pin_server: "node-0"
      pin_client: "node-1"
      pair: 1
      test_types:
        - tcp_download
      runtime: 30
```

The new fields :

`elasticsearch.server` this is the elasticsearch cluster ip you want to send the result data to for long term storage.

`elasticsearch.port` port which elasticsearch is listening, typically `9200`.

`user` provide a user id to the metadata that will be sent to Elasticsearch, this makes finding the results easier.

By default we will utilize the `flent-results` index for Elasticsearch.

Deploying the above(assuming pairs is set to 1) would result in

```bash
# oc get pods -n ripsaw-system
NAME                                            READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
benchmark-operator-f84bdbd8f-n6cnc              3/3     Running     0          34m
flent-bench-client-10.116.0.54-533b6892-dc5cd   0/1     Completed   0          32m
```

The first pod is our Operator orchestrating the Flent workload.

To review the results, `oc logs <client>`, the top of the output is
the actual workload that was passed to flent (From the values in the custom resource).

Note: If cleanup is not set in the spec file then the client pods will be killed after
600 seconds from it's completion. The server pods will be cleaned up immediately
after client job completes

```
