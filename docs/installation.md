## Installation
This guide uses minishift version v1.33.0+ as the local Kubernetes cluster
and quay.io for the public registry. We also test on minikube version v0.35+.
`kubectl` is used but can be substituted* with `oc`.

### Supported versions
* [OKD](https://www.okd.io/)
  * Experimental: 3.11
* [OpenShiftÂ® Container Platform](https://www.openshift.com/products/container-platform/)
  * Fully supported: 4.0
  * Experimental: 3.11
* [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
  * Experimental: 1.11-1.13

Note: Experimental tag refers to some workloads that might be functioning

### Requirements
<!---
TODO(aakarsh):
Get the specific versions for requirements
-->

The main requirements are as follows:
* Running Kubernetes cluster - [supported versions](#Supported-Versions)
* [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
* [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Note: Please login as admin user

The following requirements are needed to make/test changes to operator:
* [operator-sdk](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk)
* [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

Note: You also require a [quay](https://quay.io/) account to push images

The following optional requirements are needed if using OKD/OCP < 4.0:
* [dep](https://golang.github.io/dep/docs/installation.html)
* [operator-sdk](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk)
* [go](https://golang.org/dl/)
* [OLM](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager)

The workloads could also have their own requirements which would be specified
in the installation guide.

### Deploying operator

```bash
# git clone https://github.com/cloud-bulldozer/ripsaw
# cd benchmark-operator
# export KUBECONFIG=<your_kube_config> # if not already done
# kubectl create -f deploy
# kubectl create -f resources/crds/benchmark_v1alpha1_benchmark_crd.yaml
# kubectl create -f resources/operator.yaml
```

### Running workload
Now that we've deployed our operator, follow workload specific instructions to
run workloads:
* [uperf](uperf.md)
* [fio](fio.md)
* [sysbench](sysbench.md)
* [couchbase](couchbase.md)
* [YCSB](ycsb.md)

If you want to add a new workload please follow these [instructions](../CONTRIBUTE.md#Add-workload) to submit a PR

### Clean up
Now that we're running workloads we can cleanup by running following commands

```bash
# kubectl delete -f resources/crds/benchmark_v1alpha1_benchmark_cr.yaml # if not already done and assuming this was the resource file passed
# kubectl delete -f resources/crds/benchmark_v1alpha1_benchmark_crd.yaml
# kubectl delete -f resources/operator.yaml
# kubectl delete -f deploy
```
