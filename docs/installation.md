## Installation
This guide uses minishift version v1.33.0+ as the local Kubernetes cluster
and quay.io for the public registry. We also test on minikube version v0.35+.
`kubectl` is used but can be substituted* with `oc`.

### Supported versions
* [OKD](https://www.okd.io/)
  * Experimental: 3.11
* [OpenShiftÂ® Container Platform](https://www.openshift.com/products/container-platform/)
  * Fully supported: 4.0
  * Experimental: 3.11
* [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
  * Experimental: 1.11-1.13

> Note: Experimental tag refers to some workloads that might be functioning

### Requirements
<!---
TODO(aakarsh):
Get the specific versions for requirements
-->

The main requirements are as follows:
* Running Kubernetes cluster - [supported versions](#Supported-Versions)
* [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
* [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

> Note: Please login as admin user

The following requirements are needed to make/test changes to operator:
* [operator-sdk](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk)
* [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

> Note: You also require a [quay](https://quay.io/) account to push images

The following optional requirements are needed if using OKD/OCP < 4.0:
* [dep](https://golang.github.io/dep/docs/installation.html)
* [operator-sdk](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk)
* [go](https://golang.org/dl/)

> Note: The workloads may also have their own requirements which will be specified in their respective docs.

### Deploying operator
> Note: The benchmark-operator's code-name is **ripsaw**, so the names are used interchangeably in the docs.

First we'll need to clone the operator:

```bash
# git clone https://github.com/cloud-bulldozer/ripsaw
# cd ripsaw
# export KUBECONFIG=<your_kube_config> # if not already done
```

We maintain all resources created/required by ripsaw in the namespace
_ripsaw_, so we'll first create the namespace:

```bash
# kubectl apply -f deploy/namespace.yaml
```

Optionally, it may be useful to add and use a context so that administrative `kubectl` commands for
ripsaw do not require a `--namespace ripsaw` argument:

> Note: With OpenShift this is more simply done with the `oc project ripsaw` command.

```bash
# kubectl config set-context ripsaw --namespace=ripsaw --cluster=<your_cluster_name> --user=<your_cluster_admin_user>
# kubectl config use-context ripsaw
``` 

We'll now apply the common prerequisites and deploy the operator pod.

```bash
# kubectl apply -f deploy/common.yaml
# kubectl apply -f deploy/operator.yaml
```

#### Experimental Operator

We are currently experimenting with storing results in a pv attached to operator pod
and some workload pods such as [uperf](uperf.md). This will also enable us to send results
to a data store like ElasticSearch. If you'd like to try this out please use operator definition
stored in [operator_store_results](../deploy/experimental/operator_store_results.yaml) after creating a pvc
as follows:

```bash
# kubectl apply -f deploy/common.yaml
# kubectl apply -f deploy/experimental/result-pvc.yaml
# kubectl apply -f deploy/experimental/operator_store_results.yaml
```

### Running infras and workloads
With the ripsaw operator running, follow the role-specific instructions to
run infras and workloads:
* [uperf](uperf.md)
* [fio](fio.md)
* [fio distributed](fio_distributed.md)
* [iperf3](iperf.md)
* [sysbench](sysbench.md)
* [couchbase](couchbase.md)
* [YCSB](ycsb.md)
* [Bring your own workload](byowl.md)

If you want to add a new workload please follow these [instructions](../CONTRIBUTE.md#Add-workload) to submit a PR

### Clean up
Now that we're running workloads we can cleanup by running following commands

```bash
# kubectl delete -f <your_cr_file>
# kubectl delete -f deploy/operator.yaml
# kubectl delete -f deploy/common.yaml
```
